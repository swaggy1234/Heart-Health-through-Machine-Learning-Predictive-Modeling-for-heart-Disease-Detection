The fight against heart disease is a pressing and ongoing battle in
todayâ€™s medical community. The ability to recognize and predict
the presence of heart disease early on is critical for preventing
related deaths. Recognizing the importance of the topic, we
trained and evaluated several machine learning models to predict
the presence of heart disease in an individual according to
various medical indicators. All models will be evaluated
according to accuracy, and, for final decision making, recall.
Ultimately, a hyper-tuned Random Forest Classifier will be chosen
to make our final predictions, and these predictions will be
evaluated.
